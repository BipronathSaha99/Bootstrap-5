Bootstrap 5 Containers

Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes available-

(1) ".container" can provide the "fixed width container"
(2) ".cotainer-fluid" can provide the "full width container" spanning the entire width of the viewport

Fixed Container 
Its width(max-width) will change on different sizes:

- Extra Small (<576px): 100%
- Small (>=576px):540px
- Medium (>=768px): 720px
- Large (>=992px): 960px
- Extra Large (>=1200px): 1140px
- XXL(>=1400px): 1320px

Fluid Container
That will always span the entire width of the screen (width is always 100%):


Container Padding
By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. For example, .pt-5 means "add a large top padding".
